# php-root-cacert-bundle
A library to safely add the CA root certificates into your programmes ssl validations.

This library was made to answer a common error :
`SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`
without disabling the certificate when calling the resolving library (like cURL)
and without changing the server configuration in ini files.

This library uses the [https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
source file to update its contents. This library is updated once a week, every sunday.
